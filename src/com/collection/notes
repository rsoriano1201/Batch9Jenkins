Why not use local computers/laptops to host the websites?
1) I would have to keep my laptop/computer on all the time
2) I have to make sure its secure all the time
3) I have to make sure my laptop/computer is always connected to power and internet

For these reasons we use servers
Always connected to power and high spreed internet
Special layers of physical security

SDLC:
1)BA collects the requirements from the client and creates
software requirement specificiation SRS
2) Architects will create the software design document
3) devs develop the code on local computers/laptops once ready they run test cases and once all the test cases
are passed they will request the IT department to deploy this code to the DEV server
4) QA will request IT or devops team to deploy the code on QA servers will verify the change and start testing it
5) if required application is delayed on performance and security servers
6) once everything is tested on QA server application is deployed on staging server
7) once testing is completed on staging it will be deployed on UAT servers
8) Production server
